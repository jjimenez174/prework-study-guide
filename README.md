# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is for boot camp students. It has information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

I built this project to understand what coding is and how to build a website. I learned the foundation and all the elements that are used to build a website. 

## Installation

## Usage

We can choose from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git to study the notes for each topic. Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I. A console panel should open to the side of the webpage. The list of the topics would come up and choose which topic to study first.
